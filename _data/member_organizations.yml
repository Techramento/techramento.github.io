    We are excited to build a great community focused on all things Javascript.
    That means learning about new standards like ES6, frameworks like Polymer
    and React, tooling like Browserify and GulpJS, robotics like NodeBots and
    Johnny-Five, libraries like D3 and Lodash, conferences like JSConf and
    JSFest, and everything else that is out there or yet to be created!

    Hangout with Javascript developers & talk about Javascript (or don't) with
    tasty beverages (or not) in Sacramento. Creating a social space to build a
    community. No requirement to drink to participate!
